<p>My research aims at exploring the drivers of diversity in both modern and ancient marine ecosystems.</p>

<p>During the duration of my Masterâ€™s degree I investigated the evolution of the conodont genus <em>Sweetognathus</em>.</p>

<p>My current research is exploring the ultrastructure in conodont P1 elements related to dietary constraints, as well as looking at overall controls on <em>Sweetognathus</em> diversity during the Permian.</p>

<p>Additionally, some of my previous research was writing historical geologic case studies for use in undergraduate classrooms, and dental taphonomy in mammals from Saskatchewan.</p>

<p>Future research hopes to explore the role developmental plasticity plays in community assemblage and diversity patterns, and the predicting of ecosystem health based on ecosystem interactions.</p>
