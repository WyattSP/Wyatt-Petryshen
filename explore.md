I'm Wyatt Petryshen

I grew up in Calgary, Alberta, but have spent a large part of my life in the Kootenays.

In addition to science, I like mountain and road biking, climbing, skiing, music, and programming.

One of my current passion projects include making an app to recommend coffee roasters based on your favorites!
