# Research

My research aims at exploring the drivers of diversity in both modern and ancient marine systems.

During the duration of my Master's degree I investigated the evolution of the conodont genus *Sweetognathus*.

My current research is exploring the ultrastructure in conodont P1 elements related to dietary constraints.

Addiontioally, some of my previous research was writing historical geologic case studies for usuage in undergraduate classrooms, and dental taphonomy in mammals from Saskatchewan.
