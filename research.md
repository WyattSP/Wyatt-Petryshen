# Research

My research aims at exploring the drivers of diversity in both modern and ancient marine ecosystems.

During the duration of my Master's degree I investigated the evolution of the conodont genus *Sweetognathus*.

My current research is exploring the ultrastructure in conodont P1 elements related to dietary constraints, as well as looking at overall controls on *Sweetognathus* diversity during the Permian.

Additionally, some of my previous research was writing historical geologic case studies for use in undergraduate classrooms, and dental taphonomy in mammals from Saskatchewan.

Future research hopes to explore the role developmental plasticity plays in community assemblage and diversity patterns, and the predicting of ecosystem health based on ecosystem interactions.

# Images Explained

## Conodont Element

>A P1 element from the conodont *Sweetognathus whitei*. The P1 element would have had an analogous function to mammalian molars, helping the animal to process food. A conodont's feeding apparatus would have looked very similar to the mouth of a modern-day lamprey. This specimen was collected from the Tensleep Formation in Wyoming, USA.

## Functional Surface

>A close up image of the functional surface from a conodont P1 element. The functional surface would have been the portion of the element in physical contact with food material while it was feeding. The presence of the little bumps on its surface may have added it in food processing.

## Fossil Plaque

>Could these be the fossils of a 295 million-year old plaque bacteria? These small chains of rod-like fossils were found covering the surface of a conodont element retrieved from the Tensleep Formation, Wyoming. More on this to come!

## Histological Section

>The material properties of an organisms hard-tissues, like another part of an organism, will be adapted to function best in certain environments. This is a histological section through the P1 element a conodont from the genus *Sweetognathus whitei*. Thin growth layers, called lamellar tissue is seen composing the majority of the element. Near the upper surface, patches of white matter is also seen. Is this white matter adapted to deal with certain mechanical stresses related to the animals feeding habit? More research to come!
